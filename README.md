  <p>Elegant zeplin client with a focus on offline experience, speed and UX</p>
  
</div>

## ❓ Why
I use zeplin every day. I'm mainly browsing screens and discussing with UI/UX and PO teams. Although it's great most of the time, it lacks the desired features. Offline experience, change image quality, client caching, disabling layers and assets, lazy loading, etc.

It won't be a one-to-one match to zeplin but an alternative for viewing and moving quickly between projects and screens. I'll try to implement core features as much as possible.
